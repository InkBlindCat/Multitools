# Multitools

This mod adds new tools capable of breaking both stone and wooden blocks.
These tools combine the behavior of a pickaxe and a hatchet, reducing the need to switch tools during gameplay.

Multitools are more expensive to craft than standard tools, but offer increased durability as compensation.
